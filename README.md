We used the following provided image targets:
- stones
- tarmac

11. Missing features:

- Playing Cards: We were unable to support peeking at cards. Ideally, we wanted to allow users to look at cards without revealing them to other players.
- Playing Cards: We were unable to support group moving of chips and cards. Ideally, we wanted to support easier moving capabilities to allow users to move many cards and chips at once rather than one at a time.

12. Bugs in your code and in any system you used:

- Jacks: when collecting the ball in a jacks turn, the collected jacks in your hand may push the ball rather than collecting it. This may be because the ball must make contact with the hand toolbar and is instead contacting the jack pieces causing it to be pushed away.

13. Asset sources: 

- Free Little Games Asset Pack by Ferocious Industries: Used for game peices
- Space Robot Kyle by Unity Technologies: Used for wayfinding in Cards game
