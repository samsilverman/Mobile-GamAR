# Mobile-GamAR

Mobile GamAR is a mobile augmented reality application that allows users to conveniently and intuitively play virtual board and card games. With the aid of a mobile device, users can control a variety game pieces for Poker and Jacks.

### Built With

Mobile GamAR was built with:

* [Unity](https://unity.com)
* [PTC Vuforia Engine](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following software to run Mobile GamAR:

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) - Version 2019.3.12f1 (Newer versions may work but untested).

Additionally, you will need to print a variety of AR targets used in the project. These targets can be found [here](Misc/ImageTargets.pdf). The following image targets are used:

* Stones
* Tarmac
* Vortex

**NOTE:** Image targets work best when kept straight and crease free. It is best if the image targets are glued to a hard surface like cardboard.
